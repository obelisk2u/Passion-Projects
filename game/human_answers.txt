I understand that working from home can be a new adjustment, but there are multiple things that you can do to be productive and work from the comfort of your home. One of the first things that you can do is get up early in the morning. When you get a good routine together, it will be easier for you to become more motivated. Also, something else you might want to consider is creating a home office. When you organize your space to be productive, you will get productive results. I hope this was helpful to you in your pursuit to adjust to the current climate of things.
